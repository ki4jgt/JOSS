# JOSS
JSON Open Syndication Standard

JOSS is an attempt to make news syndication more open and accessible to programmers and parsing. Programming languages (Python and JavaScript) and programmers naturally favor JSON but news readers and syndicates are all using XML -- which has a huge overhead compared to the content it delivers. XML requires special parsing libraries and maneuvers. On the other hand, JSON requires no parsing and no maneuvers to be understood by most programming languages.
